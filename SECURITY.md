# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory "Report a Vulnerability" tab.

All security vulnerabilities will be promptly verified and addressed.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions of Next and other dependencies by maintaining lock files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`) in order to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
